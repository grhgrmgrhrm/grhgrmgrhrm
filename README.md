## At the present time

I continue to learn HTML, JavaScript, React and TypeScript

### Brief information about me

I have been working in web development for a little more than 9 years-freelance and project work. All this time, I was engaged in both the layout of sites from the customer's layouts, and the creation of sites on content management systems ( Joomla, Wordpress). In the process, the knowledge was not enough, so I turned my attention to JavaScript and React to create easily scalable applications.

Easy to teach new things, assiduous and stress-resistant. I lead an active and healthy lifestyle, there are no bad habits.

You can look at some code examples at me on [my github](https://github.com/grhgrmgrhrm)

### My skills

I am learning JavaScript and React, recently started Typescript. Familiar with Agile and Waterfall development methodology. In my work I use the Git version control system, the development environment is WebStorm, for minor edits of the Sublime Text code.
